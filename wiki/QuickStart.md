# Trying OpenCount out #

If you want to try OpenCount out, here's how to install it quickly:

1. Install Ubuntu.  We recommend a 64-bit version of Ubuntu.  If installing in a virtual machine, we recommend the Desktop Edition, and if possible, use virtualization software that allows virtualized software to run on multiple cores.  See [OSRecommendations](OSRecommendations.md) for more details.

2. Install OpenCount.  See InstallNotes for details on packages you will need to install first, then clone the OpenCount git repository and finish the installation instructions.

3. Follow the [Tutorial](Tutorial.md), to learn how to use OpenCount on a sample election.

# Processing large elections #

If you want to use OpenCount to process a large election, our advice is:

1. Select a powerful computer with a high-end, multi-core CPU and lots of RAM.  See HardwareRecommendations for our specific recommendations.

2. Install Ubuntu.  We recommend a bare-metal, 64-bit Ubuntu install (rather than using virtualization software).  See [OSRecommendations](OSRecommendations.md) for details.

3. Finally, install OpenCount.  Follow the same instructions as above.
