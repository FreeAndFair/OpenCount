OpenCount is computationally intensive.
You will want to run it on a computer that is as fast as possible.
Below, we list some guidance to help selecting a computer to run
OpenCount on.

# Processors (CPUs) #

Because OpenCount requires so much computation, we recommend using
a multi-core machine.
You want as many cores as you can get: the more, the better.
OpenCount can use all available cores to parallelize its computation
and analyze the ballots more quickly.
We have used a quad-core (4-core) and a hexa-core (6-core) machine.
You also want each processor to be as fast as possible.

# Memory (RAM) #

If buying a new machine, we recommend buying as much as you can reasonably get.  Get 16GB if you can get it, or if not,
as much as you can get.

# Example #

One of our machines is a desktop PC with an Intel 6-core 3.2GHz i7 CPU (the i7-3930K) and 16GB of RAM.  This works very well.  The 3930K is about the highest-end CPU currently available at a reasonable price.  (You can get more computation power if you buy a multi-socket Intel Xeon server-class workstation, but the cost goes way up.)

We have also successfully used OpenCount on a machine with an Intel 4-core 3.1 GHz i7 CPU (the i7-950) and 12GB of RAM.
