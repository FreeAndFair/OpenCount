OpenCount
===

*OpenCount* is part of the Verfiable Elections software suite of
projects, developed by Verifiable Elections, Inc. It has two
components: *OpenCount Auditor* (hereafter, *Auditor*), which is designed
to assist with post-election audits of elections conducted using
optical-scan paper ballots, and *OpenCount Tabulator* (hereafter,
*Tabulator*), which tabulates results from ballots cast in an election.

*Auditor* enables risk-limiting ballot-level audits, which are an
innovative, efficient, and cost-effective way to provide transparency
and check the accuracy of election results. It has been used to
support the
[California Secretary of State's Post Election Risk-Limiting Audit Pilot Program][http://www.sos.ca.gov/voting-systems/oversight/risk-limiting-pilot.htm].
During *Auditor*'s development, we have applied it to ballots cast in
elections held in ten California counties.

*Tabulator* helps count a set of paper ballots that were cast in an
election. If you provide scanned images of all of the paper ballots,
*Tabulator* will identify all votes on the ballots and count and
tally the votes. *Tabulator* currently supports optical-scan ballots
associated with Diebold (Premier), ES&S, Hart, and Sequoia ballot
styles.

History

OpenCount was originally developed as part of research conducted by
researchers at UC Berkeley and UC San Diego, including Kai Wang, Eric
Kim, Nicholas Carlini, Theron Ji, Arel Cordero, Andrew Chang, George
Yiu, Ivan Motyashov, Daniel Nguyen, Raji Srikantan, Alan Tsai, Keaton
Mowery, David Wagner, and others. It was partially funded by the US
National Science Foundation and by the TRUST center; we gratefully
acknowledge their support. We also thank the California Secretary of
State, election officials at Alameda, Leon, Madera, Marin, Merced,
Napa, Orange, San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz, Stanislaus, Ventura, and
Yolo counties, and Clear Ballots for data and assistance.
