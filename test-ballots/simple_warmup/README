This is a set of nine (9) artificially-marked ballots, to be used as a 
simple test dataset for OpenCount.

There are two different ballot styles (groupA, groupB). These ballots
are double-sided, and the filenames alternate. The vendor is: Hart.

The test images were created by manually adding voter marks in a simple
image-editor program (Kolourpaint) to blank sample ballot images. 

No voter data is present in this dataset.

Expected OpenCount results can be found in:
    results/election_results.txt
    results/election_results_batches.txt
    results/cvr.csv
    results/cvr/*
